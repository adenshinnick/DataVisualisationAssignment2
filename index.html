                        <p>The number of movies produced each year has exploded. This chart shows the total number of films released over time, broken down by their primary genre, illustrating the shifting tastes of audiences and the sheer scale of the industry's expansion.</p>
                        <p> Throughout the years, it is obvious that drama films and documentaries are the most popular out of them all, however comedies seem to be climbing in cultural significance as well. An interesting point to note about the data on the right is the year that COVID-19 started. The only drop in movies from year to year can be found at this exact year, obviously due to lockdowns and restrictions.</p>

                        <p>Have movies gotten longer? This chart shows the density of movie runtimes over 5-year periods. The size of the circle indicates how many films were produced in that time and runtime bracket, revealing a clear trend towards a standard 90-100 minute runtime.</p>
                        <p>With the increase in social media and phone usage, it is only sensible to assume that people's attention spans have gotten shorter. Coincidentally, or maybe not, is the explosion in the amount of 90 minute films being made.</p>

                        <p>Over the years, critics have gotten harsher and harsher. Or have movies gotten worse? It is hard to tell without having seen every movie, but the average consenseus is that while movies are being made with higher and higher quality, the sheer number of films being made means that the bar continues to get higher, and critics become harsher and harsher.</p>
